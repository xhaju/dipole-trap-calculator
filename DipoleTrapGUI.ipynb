    "## Dipole trapping.\n",
    "When a dielectric particle is placed in an electric field, there is an interaction between  the dipole moment of this particle and intensity gradient of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispersive part of this interaction gives rise to a conservative force, which we can describe with a potential $U_{\\rm dip}$. We can use minima of this potential to trap the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the absorptive part of this potential leads to photon scattering, which sets limits to the performance of the trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dipole potential and scattering rate\n",
    "\n",
    "An electric field ${\\bf E}$ interacting with a material induces a dipole moment ${\\bf p}$, which will oscillate with the electric field. These, in the simplest case, are harmonic functions with a frequency $\\omega$: ${\\bf E},{\\bf p}\\propto \\exp(-i\\omega t)$. The amplitude of the dipole moment created is related to the amplitude of the electric field via the complex polarisabiility $\\alpha$ (which may be frequency dependent) as follows:\n",
    "$$ p = \\alpha E.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction potential (the dispersive part of the interaction) of the induced dipole moment in the driving field is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\rm dip} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left\\langle{\\bf p E} \\right\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2\\epsilon_0 c} \\Re{\\alpha} I$$\n",
    "The field intensity is $I = 2\\epsilon_0 c \\left| E\\right|^2$, and the factor of $1/2$ just takes into account that the dipole moment is an induced, not a permanent one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dipole force results from the gradient of the potential,\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf F}_{\\rm dip} = -\\nabla U_{\\rm dip}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorptive part of the interaction arises from the imaginary part of the polarisability. The power absorbed is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_{\\rm abs} = \\left\\langle \\dot{\\bf p}{\\bf E} \\right\\rangle = 2\\omega \\Im (p E^*) = \\frac{\\omega}{\\epsilon_0 c} \\Im(\\alpha) I.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we imagine light as a stream of photons with energy $\\hbar \\omega$, absorption can be interpreted as photon inelastic scattering and spontaneous re-emission\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_{\\rm sc} = \\frac{P_{\\rm abs}}{\\hbar \\omega} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar \\epsilon_0 c} \\Im(\\alpha) I$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two important quantities for dipole traps are thus the interaction potential $U_{\\rm dip}$ and the scattered radiation power $P_{\\rm abs}$, in terms of the position-dependent field intensity $I({\\bf r})$ and the polarisability $\\alpha(\\omega)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we derive the expression for the polarizability, which will determine the response of the atoms to an incident electric field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomic response \n",
    "In a semiclassical approach, if we imagine the atom as a two-level quantum system interacting with a classical radiation field, the damping rate $\\Gamma$ (corresponding to the spontaneous decay rate of the excited level) is determined by the dipole matrix element between ground and excited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma = \\frac{\\omega_0^3}{3\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar c^3} \\left| \\left\\langle e |\\mu |g\\right\\rangle\\right|^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $D$ lines of alkali atoms (e.g. Rb), we can consider the Lorentz's model of a classical oscillator to obtain an expression for the polarisability (check Eqs.(6) to (8) from <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9902072\">arXiv:physics/9902072v1</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = 6\\pi \\epsilon_0 c^3 \\frac{\\Gamma/\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0^2 -\\omega^2 -{\\rm i}\\,({\\omega^3}/{\\omega_0^2})\\,\\Gamma}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is valid away from saturation, when the scattering rate $\\Gamma_{\\rm sc}\\ll \\Gamma$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotating wave approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above expression for the polarisability, for large detunings and negligible saturation, the following expressions for the dipole potential and the scattering rate hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\rm dip} = -\\frac{3 \\pi c^2}{2 \\omega_0^3} \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\omega_0 - \\omega}+\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\omega_0 + \\omega} \\right) I ({\\bf r}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_{\\rm sc} = \\frac{3 \\pi c^2}{2 \\omega_0^3} \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\omega_0 - \\omega}+\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\omega_0 + \\omega} \\right)^2 I ({\\bf r}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases of practical interest, the detuning $\\Delta \\equiv \\omega - \\omega_0$ is $| \\Delta |\\ll \\omega_0$, which allows us to neglect the counter-rotating terms resonant at $\\omega = -\\omega_0$., and to set $\\omega/\\omega_0\\approx 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the general expressions for the dipole potential and scattering rate simplify in this case to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_{\\rm sc}({\\bf r}) = \\frac{3\\pi c^2}{2 \\hbar \\omega_0^3} \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Delta}\\right)^2 I({\\bf r}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\rm dip}({\\bf r}) = \\frac{3\\pi c^2}{2 \\omega_0^3}  \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Delta} I({\\bf r}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following simple relation exists between the scattering rate and the dipole potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hbar \\Gamma_{\\rm sc} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Delta}  U_{\\rm dip}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following comments are in order:\n",
    "- Red detuned light ($\\Delta < 0$) makes the dipole potential negative (attractive) on the intensity maxima, and viceversa.\n",
    "- Since the potential scales with $I/\\Delta$ but the scattering rate does so as $I/\\Delta^2$, it is advantageous use more detuned light to reduce the ratio between the potential and the scattering rate, at the expense of using more trapping power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilevel atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of laser light on multilevel atoms can be calculated in the time-independent, second-order, perturbation theory. The oscillating field creates an energy shift to the different states. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-level atom, the optically induced shift (\"light-shift\") of the ground-state exactly corresponds to the dipole trapping potential for the two-level atom (the excited state shows the opposite shift). Indeed, if the interaction Hamiltonian is $\\mathcal{H}_1 = -\\mu E$, this shift is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta E = \\pm \\frac{\\left| \\left\\langle e |\\mu |g\\right\\rangle\\right|^2}{\\Delta} |E|^2 = \\pm \\frac{3\\pi c^2}{2 \\omega_0^3}  \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Delta} I({\\bf r}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a multilevel atom, we need to know the dipole matrix elements $\\mu_{ij} = \\left\\langle e_i |\\mu |g_j\\right\\rangle$ between the specific electronic ground ($g_j$) and excited ($e_i$) states. We can obtain the transition matrix elements as a product of the reduced matrix element $\\lVert{\\mu}\\rVert$ and the transition coefficient $c_{ij}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_{ij} = c_{ij} \\lVert \\mu \\rVert.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fully reduced matrix element depends on the electronic orbital wavefunction. The coefficients $c_{ij}$ depend on laser polarisation and the electronic and nuclear angular momenta involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these reduced matrix elements, one can write the complete shift to the ground state $\\left| g_i\\right\\rangle$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta E_i = \\frac{3\\pi c^2 \\Gamma}{2 \\omega_0^3} I \\times \\sum_j \\frac{c_{ij}^2}{\\Delta_{ij}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this result, and assuming that all optical detunings are large compared with the excited state hyperfine splitting $\\Delta_{\\rm HFS}^\\prime$, one can derive the result for the potential of a ground state with total angular momentum $F$ and magnetic quantum number $m_F$, valid for both circular an linear polarisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\rm dip}({\\bf r}) = \\frac{\\pi c^2 \\Gamma}{2 \\omega_0^3}  \\left( \\frac{2+\\mathcal{P}_{g_F m_F}}{\\Delta_{2,F}} + \\frac{1-\\mathcal{P}_{g_F m_F}}{\\Delta_{1,F}}\\right) I({\\bf r})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g_F$ is the Landé factor, $\\mathcal{P}$ characterises the laser polarisation ($\\mathcal{P} = 0, \\pm 1$ for linearly and circularly $\\sigma^\\pm$ polarised light).\n",
    "The detunings $\\Delta_{2,F}$ and $\\Delta_{1,F}$ refer to the energy splitting between the particular ground state $^2{\\rm S}_{1/2}F$ and the center of the hyperfine split $^2{\\rm P}_{3/2}$ and $^2{\\rm P}_{1/2}$ excited states, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two terms of the brackets correspond to the contributions of the  $D_2$ and $D_1$ lines respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the photon scattering rate, the same line strength factors are relevant as for the dipole potential, thus\n",

    "$$\\Gamma_{\\rm sc}({\\bf r}) = \\frac{\\pi c^2 \\Gamma^2}{2\\hbar \\omega_0^3}  \\left( \\frac{2}{\\Delta_{2,F}^2} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta_{1,F}^2}\\right) I({\\bf r})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is independent of $m_F$, but in general depends on the hyperfine state F via the detunings.\n",
    "For linearly polarised light, optical pumping tends to distribute the population among the $m_F$ states equally, leading to a complete depolarisation.  \n",
    "For circular polarisation, Zeeman pumping becomes important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use Steck's data, which obtains the reduced density matrix for the D1 and D2 lines, both $\\Gamma$ and $\\omega_0$ need to be particularized for each of the transitions in the equations for $U_{\\rm dip}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm sc}$.\n",
